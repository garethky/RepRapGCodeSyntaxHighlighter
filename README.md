# About
An [Iro](https://eeyo.io/iro/documentation/index.html) grammar for [RepRap's G-code](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode) flavor. This flavor supports a [custom expression syntax](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/GCode_Meta_Commands) that doesn't appear in other G-code flavors.

# Status
Very much in development, still trying to work all the bugs out. Also some of the results generated by Iro are not perfect and need hand editing. Initally only SublimeText3 is being generated as its the only one I'm verifying.
